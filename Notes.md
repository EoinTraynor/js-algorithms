# Notes

## Memoization
Store the arguments and result of each function call
__If the function is called again with the same arguments, return the pre-computed result, so the function does not have to run again__

## Data Structures
Ways of organising information with optimal __runtime complexity__ for adding or removing records
Javascript natively implements several data structures.
* Queue
* Stack

### Linked List
An ordered collection of data, the collection contains a number of nodes.
Each node contains 
1. Data e.g. String, object etc.
2. A reference to the next node (A chain). 

* Head Node: The first node in a linked list,
* Tail Node: The last node in a linked list, identified as it doesn't have a reference to a subsequent node
